          <div class="content"><p>From pocket squares to housewares, putting initials on stuff is turning into one of the biggest trends of 2013. (At JCrew.com’s new “monogram shop,” you can have a few letters stitched onto any cashmere knit or shirt pocket for $10.) Monograms never truly went out of style, which makes this particular bandwagon an easy one to climb aboard. And here’s the thing: you don’t need anyone’s approval to put your stamp on a favourite item. Nor do you need to use your own initials: TMI, WTF, S&P. You can get creative. If the point of a monogram is to make sure an article doesn’t get lost in a sea of blue button-downs, go ahead and make yours count.</p> <div class='byline'>—Chris Johns</div></div>
