          <div class="content"><p> In the 1900s, a U.S. army officer named George Owen Squier developed a method to transmit radio signals along electrical and telephone wires. He planned to use his discovery to send music directly into people’s homes, and in 1922 partnered with a utility company to found Wired Radio. But wireless radio took off instead, and the company shifted its focus to providing background music to hotels, restaurants and retailers. In 1934, it combined the words “music” and “Kodak” to arrive at a new name: Muzak. </p> <p>Squier died of pneumonia that same year, but his company thrived. Muzak hired bands and singers to record covers of popular songs along with original compositions to build its library. Quality wasn’t the foremost concern. One early session featured the National Fascist Militia Band, then on-tour in the U.S. from Benito Mussolini’s Italy. There were sessions with well-known artists, too, including Rosemary Clooney and Fats Waller. Muzak amassed a collection of roughly 5,000 songs within a few years, more than any record label at the time. </p> <p>In the 1940s, the company’s executives developed a theory called Stimulus Production. Armed with reams of pseudo-scientific studies, they claimed that workers of all sorts were happier and more productive when subjected to 15-minute sets of benign music that built gradually in tempo and intensity. The concept registered in the corporate world, and Muzak proliferated in office buildings. It was also around that time that Muzak’s mellow tunes became known as “elevator music.” Skyscrapers were popping up in big cities, and many people found using elevators to be a nerve-wracking experience. Muzak promised to make the journey pleasurable, even partnering with the Otis Elevator Co. on a print ad that compared riding an elevator to “gliding on the notes of a lilting melody.”</p></div></article>
